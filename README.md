# BIJLI â€” Search in a database in O(1) time

This is final project for the Data Structures I Course.
<br> In this project, I used CSV module to implement CRUD operations on CSV file using Python Programming Language. The CSV file has over 400,000 records of phone numbers. Searching them linearly may cause a lot of time. <br>
Therefore, I used Hash Table to search phone numbers in O(1). As `BIJLI` literlay means electric in urdu.



## Installation

Install `bijli.py` with Python 3.x or greater

```bash
  cd 'BIJLI-Hash-Table-Database'
  python3 bijli.py
```

    
## Documentation

To manually add your own database, add CSV file to root folder.
<br>
Then, add it to `file_path` variable in `read_database_linear.py` and `read_database_linked.py`.
<br>Remember, the path needs to be relative!
